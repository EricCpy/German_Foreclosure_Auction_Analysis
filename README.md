## German Foreclosure Auction Sites
- https://www.zvg-portal.de/ (official website of the german government where foreclosure auctions can be found for selected regional courts) (Effort: uniform general description, more detailed information in unstructured PDFs, which would need to be extracted)
- https://versteigerungspool.de/ (compiles foreclosures, scrapes the content of the official portal, and presents it more clearly, but sometimes lacks the full description)
- https://www.zvg-online.net/ (shows only a few foreclosures, but provides appraisals and a property expos√©, presenting a lot of detailed information about the properties)
- https://www.zwangsversteigerung.de/ (does not show current auction dates, only useful for visualizing foreclosures)
